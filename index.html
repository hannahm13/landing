		<h2>1. What is the concept of this app?</h2>
		<p>
		Trip'&'Fash is your new trip guide. If you're an art lover, a fashion lover, or that you want to discover a city by the style of its citizens, this is made for you. You will here be able to dress up as an american, a french, or a chinese, without following any touristic discovery tour  . You will become a real local, and a very "Chic" one.
